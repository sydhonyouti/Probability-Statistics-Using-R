# Problem 1: Use the data in Example 8.5.4, comprising a sample of
#n = 10 lactic acid measurements in cheese. Assume, as we
#did there, that the lactic acid measurements are a random
#sample from the normal distribution with unknown mean
#mu and unknown variance sigma^2. Wish to test H0: mu <= 1.2 and H1: mu > 1.2

#a) Perform the level a0 = .05 test of these hypotheses
acidData <- c(.86,1.53,1.57,1.81,.99,1.09,1.29,1.78,1.29,1.58)
t.test(acidData,mu=1.2)

#b) compute the p-value
p <- .1181/2

# Problem 8: Use R to sketch several examples of the F distribution on the same graph.

# Problem 9:Use R to design an experiment using the following premise.  First generate 10 random numbers 
#from the standard normal distribution.  Second, carry out a hypothesis test with at the 𝐻0:𝜇0 = 0 
#0.1 level of significance.  Repeat this 100 times and tabulate the results of the 100 tests.

# Problem 10:Use the data set mtcars which comes with the base package of R.  Gather the following data sets 
#and store them in vectors: mpg for 8 cylinder cars, mpg for 6 cylinder cars, and mpg for 4 cylinder
#cars.  Conduct two sample hypotheses tests for differences in the mean for all possible pairs
#paying careful attention to the assumption about equal variances.  Summarize your findings.
